# FEA_Projects

These are all the projects done by me in Fall 2021. Each project contains the problem as well as the solutioin path I took to solve the problem, including the FEA assumptions I made (type of element, mesh density etc). Each project also contains a theoretical prediction to vindicative ANSYS results whenever such predictions could be made.
