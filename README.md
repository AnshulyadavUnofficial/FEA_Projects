# FEA_Projects

These are all the projects done by Anshul Yadav, an EMA undergrad at UW-Madison, in Fall 2021. Each project contains the problem as well as the solutioin path he took to solve the problem, including the FEA assumptions he made (type of element, mesh density etc). Each project also contains a theoretical prediction to vindicative ANSYS results whenever such predictions could be made.
